# KnockOff-Hacky-Ducky
This is a hacky ducky from a tutorial, but instead ive made it with a usb c plug because ive never worked with one of those before. I made this cuz usb rubber duckies are cool and ive wanted to have a hackyduck or a pico duck but hackyducky is a taking a lil long with V2 and I understand its hard to maintain and get another version of it to go out. So imma make my Own! To use, flash the hacky ducky with your firmware and enjoy!
